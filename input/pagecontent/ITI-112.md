The Resource Notification Subscriber actor shall submit the FHIR Bundle resource in either XML format or JSON format thus the media type of the HTTP body shall be either `application/fhir+json` or `application/fhir+xml` respectively. The format shall match the MIME type on the `Subscription.channel.payload` element.

The Bundle is sent to the URL present in `Subscription.channel.endpoint` element, that identifies where the Resource Notification Recipient receives the notification.

It is possible to use HTTP protocol or HTTPS protocol. The HTTPS protocol is highly recommended.

The Bundle Resource sent by the Resource Notification Broker shall have:

- [Handshake Notification](StructureDefinition-IHE.DSUBm.HandshakeNotification.html)
    - the `Bundle.type` element set to `history`;
    - in the first entry the [Handshake Subscription Status](StructureDefinition-IHE.DSUBm.SubscriptionStatus-Handshake.html) resource and the `request` element shall be filled out to match a request to the $status operation;
    - no other entry shall be present.


#### 2:3.112.5.3 Expected Actions

The Resource Notification Recipient processes the message according to application-defined rules and produces a [Handshake Notification Response](#231126-handshake-notification-response-message).

    - in the first entry the [Notification Subscription Status](StructureDefinition-IHE.DSUBm.SubscriptionStatus-Event.html) resource and the `request` element shall be filled out to match a request to the $status operation;
    - zero or more additional entries, with either URLs or resources representing content, depending on the `Subscription.payload.content` and the `notificationShape` defined in the Topic of the Subscription; for additional entries, the request should be filled out in a way that makes sense given the Subscription (e.g., a POST or PUT operation on the resource, matching the event happened to that resource that trigger the notification). However, a Resource Notification Broker may choose to simply include a GET to the relevant resource instead.

When the payload content includes the resources, the notification shape shall be based on the definitions from the Topic of the Subscription:

- the resource that is the trigger for the Topic shall be included by the Resource Notification Broker
- any other resource may be included by the Resource Notification Broker; in order to include resource that could be of interest for the Resource Notification Recipient, the Resource Notification Broker should follow what is defined by the Topic of the Subscription for the notification shape.

#### 2:3.112.11.3 Expected Actions

The Resource Notification Recipient processes the message according to application-defined rules and produces an [Subscription Deactivation Response](#2311212-subscription-deactivation-notification-response-message).

If the Resource Notification Recipient is grouped with the Resource Notification Subscriber, the Resource Notification Subscriber should be aware if this notification received is related to its own unsubscription, if it is related to an unsubscription performed by another Resource Notification Subscriber, or it is related to deactivation performed by the Resource Notification Broker at the expiration time of the Subscription, and then proceeds according to its application-defined rules.


<!-- response 4-->

### 2:3.112.12 Subscription Deactivation Notification Response Message

The Resource Notification Recipient sends an Event Notification Response to respond to a [Subscription Deactivation Message](#2311211-subscription-deactivation-notification-request-message).

#### 2:3.112.12.1 Trigger Events

#### 2:3.112.12.3 Expected Actions
The Resource Notification Broker processes the message according to application-defined rules.

### 2:3.112.13 Handling Errors in Notification

After setting the `Subscription.status=error`, the Resource Notification Broker should continue to send other [Heartbeat Notification Request Message](#231127-heartbeat-notification-request-message) with `status=error` and it may continue to send other [Event Notification Request Message](#231129-event-notification-request-message) (if events occur) with `status=error`. The recommended way for the Resource Notification Broker to procede is to continue to send [Heartbeat Notification Request Message](#231127-heartbeat-notification-request-message) and [Event Notification Request Message](#231129-event-notification-request-message) for a reasonable number of times, and evaluating if these type of errors continue before totally deactivating the Subscription, setting the `Subscription.status=off`. This should be done based on the capability of the connection infrastructure.

If the Resource Notification Recipient is grouped with the Resource Notification Subscriber in an application, the Resource Notification Subscriber may handle errors or broken connections by using the $events and $status operations on the transaction Resource Subscription Search [ITI-113] and following what is defined in [Detecting Errors as a Subscriber](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-subscription-backport-ig/errors.html#detecting-errors-as-a-subscriber), [Broken Communication](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-subscription-backport-ig/errors.html#broken-communication) and [Recovering from Errors](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-subscription-backport-ig/errors.html#recovering-from-errors) sections of the [Subscriptions R5 Backport](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-subscription-backport-ig/index.html). Also, once the application has returned to a functional state, Resource Notification Subscriber should request the subscription is re-activated sending a [Update Subscription Request Message](ITI-110.html#231107-update-subscription-request-message) to the Resource Notification Broker.

### 2:3.112.14 CapabilityStatement Resource
The Resource Notification Broker implementing this transaction shall provide a CapabilityStatement Resource as described in [ITI TF-2x: Appendix Z.3](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume2/ch-Z.html#z.3-capabilitystatement-resource) indicating the transaction has been implemented. 
- FHIR Capability Statement for [Resource Notification Broker](CapabilityStatement-IHE.DSUBm.ResourceNotificationBroker.html)
- FHIR Capability Statement for [Resource Notification Broker](CapabilityStatement-IHE.DSUBm.ResourceNotificationBroker.UpdateOption.html) that support the [Updates to document sharing resources](volume-1.html#15421-updates-to-document-sharing-resources-option) option.

The Resource Notification Recipient implementing this transaction shall provide a CapabilityStatement Resource as described in [ITI TF-2x: Appendix Z.3](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume2/ch-Z.html#z.3-capabilitystatement-resource) indicating the transaction has been implemented. 
- FHIR Capability Statement for [Resource Notification Recipient](CapabilityStatement-IHE.DSUBm.ResourceNotificationRecipient.html)


### 2:3.112.15 Security Considerations

See [DSUBm Security Considerations](volume-1.html#1545-security-considerations). 

The Resource Notification Broker should confirm that the Resource Notification Recipient is still authorized to receive the information that it is searching for. To assess if a Resource Notification Recipient is still  authorized to receive the information the Resource Notification Broker may utilize additional policy defined between the actors in order to prevent the sending of notifications in particular cases. If an authorization token is used to verify the authorization of a Recipient to receive notifications, the Resource Notification Broker shall also verify that this token has not been revoked before sending the Notification Bundle Request message. 

It's highly recommended that the Resource Notification Broker should use some form of authentication method when sending a notification Message and the Resource Notification Recipient should always verify the authentication token used in this transaction. 

The Resource Notification Recipient should also be defensive and robust to a malicious client that may send a large volume of fake notifications with empty notifications, which would cause the Resource Notification Recipient to send many (potentially expensive) queries to a server.

#### 2:3.112.15.1 Security Audit Considerations

The Resource Notification Broker, when grouped with [ATNA](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-9.html) Secure Node or Secure Application Actor, shall be able to record fundamental AuditEvents for [BALP](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/BALP/index.html) [Create](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/BALP/1.1.2/StructureDefinition-IHE.BasicAudit.Create.html), when performing this transaction.
