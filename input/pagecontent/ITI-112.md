#### 3.112.5 Notification Bundle Request
This message uses the HTTP POST method on the target Resource Notification Recipient endpoint to submit the bundle resource.

##### 3.112.5.1 Trigger Events

This transaction is invoked when Resource Notification Broker has received a Resource Publish [ITI-111] that matches one (or more) subscription criteria included in the subscription resources with status=="active". 

##### 3.112.5.2 Message Semantics

The Resource Notification Broker shall initiate an HTTP request according to requirements defined in the HL7® FHIR® standard for “create” interaction (https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/http.html#create). The message uses an HTTP POST method to submit a [Bundle](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-subscription-backport-ig/StructureDefinition-backport-subscription-notification.html) FHIR Resource with the type of history. In this way, the Bundle will contain the change on the Fhir resource triggered by the Resource Publish [ITI-111].

The notification Bundle MUST have a SubscriptionStatus as the first entry. This element is necessary to describe during notifications the state of the Subscription that has been triggered.
The resource SubscriptionStatus needs to be updated by the Resource Notification Broker before sending the notification. In this resource, the Resource Notification Broker shall update the notificationEvent element by:  
- increment by one the notificationEvent.eventNumber element.
- update the notificationEvent.timestamp with the current timestamp corresponding to the notification event.
- notificationEvent.focus 
- notificationEvent.additionalContext	

The content of the notification is based on the SubscriptionTopic.notificationShape which indicates which resource shall be included in the notification. 
The notification shall include: one or more DocumentReference resource(as defined [here](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/ITI-65.html#2-3-65-provide-document-bundle-iti-65)) and zero or more  Folder type List Resources (as defined [here](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/StructureDefinition-IHE.MHD.Comprehensive.Folder.html)).

The level of detail of these resources, that the Resource Notification Broker should use in the Notification Bundle, is indicated in the Subscription.payload element. For this element are possible 3 different types of values: empty, id-only, and full-resource as defined by this [extension](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-subscription-backport-ig/StructureDefinition-backport-payload-content.html#root).

The Notification Bundle Request message is sent to the endpoint indicated in the Subscription.channel.endpoint

The content-type of the POST SHALL match the MIME type on the Subscription.channel.payload element 
??? Each Subscription.channel.header value SHALL be conveyed as an HTTP request header. [see header](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/subscription.html#2.46.8.1)

##### 3.112.5.3 Expected Actions

The Resource Notification Recipient processes the results according to application-defined rules.
The Resource Notification recipient may handle errors if detected.

#### 3.112.6 Notification Bundle Response

The Resource Notification Recipient sends a Notification Bundle Response message to respond to a Notification Bundle Request message.

##### 3.112.6.1 Trigger Events

When the Resource Notification Recipient receives the notification sends this message to the Resource Notification Broker acknowledging the reception of the notification.

##### 3.112.6.2 Message Semantics

When the Resource Notification Recipient has processed the request, it shall return an HTTP response with an overall status code.

The Resource Notification Recipient returns an HTTP status code appropriate to the processing of the create request. If the notification has been received and processed the Resource Notification Recipient shall respond with a 201 Created HTTP status code as indicated in https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/http.html#create.Otherwise, if the reception or processing of the notification has failed the Resource Notification Recipient shall respond with http 400 Bad Request.


##### 3.112.6.3 Expected Actions

The Resource Notification Recipient may handle errors like missed notifications and broken connections by using the $event and $status operations on the transaction Resource Subscription Search [ITI-113] as defined [here] (https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-subscription-backport-ig/errors.html#handling-errors).
