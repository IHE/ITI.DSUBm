### 3.114.5 Resource SubscriptionTopic Search Request Message
The Resource Notification Subscriber Request Message is a parametrized `HTTP GET` that allows to search for a list of SubscriptionTopic resources managed by the Resource Notification Broker, based on a set of search parameters.

#### 3.114.5.1 Trigger Events

A Resource Notification Subscriber sends this message to the Resource Notification Broker when it needs to discover a SubscriptionTopic resource. This normally happens before the Subscriber needs to perform a subscription.

#### 3.114.5.2 Message Semantics

The Resource Notification Subscriber sends an HTTP GET request to the Resource Notification Broker. This request shall comply with requirements specified in the HL7<sup>®</sup>
FHIR<sup>®</sup> standard <https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/http.html#search>.

The Resource Notification Subscriber Request Message shall be expressed by addressing the SubscriptionTopic Resource in the path as follows:

> GET \[base\]/SubscriptionTopic

The Resource Notification Subscriber may provide the optional parameter "_format" to specify the desired MIME-types in the response message. The Resource Notification Broker should accept `application/fhir+xml` and `application/fhir+json` as _format parameters.  For example, indicating `application/fhir+json` could result in the response from the Resource Notification Broker being a json FHIR Bundle with all the content encoded as FHIR resources.

In request message the query parameters are not allowed.  


#### 3.114.5.3 Expected Actions

The Resource Notification Broker who received the message shall process the request, according to application-defined rules, and also evaluate if the Resource Notification Subscriber can access the information. 

If the access is grant, the Resource Notification Broker shall produce a response in which shall be present at least the following SubscriptionTopic Resources:

- Patient-Dependent DocumentReference SubscriptionTopic
- Multi-Patient DocumentReference SubscriptionsTopic
- Patient-Dependent Folder SubscriptionTopic
- Patient-Dependent SubmissionSet SubscriptionTopic
- Multi-Patient SubmissionSet SubscriptionTopic

If the Resource Notification Broker supports the [Updates to document sharing resources option](#Updating-events), in the response shall be present, in addition to the previous listed, also the following SubscriptionTopic Resources:

- Patient-Dependent DocumentReference SubscriptionTopic with updates to document sharing resources option to document sharing resources option
- Multi-Patient DocumentReference SubscriptionTopic with Updates to document sharing resources option
- Patient-Dependent Folder SubscriptionTopic with Updates to document sharing resources option


### 3.114.6 Resource SubscriptionTopic Search Response Message
The Resource Notification Broker returns an HTTP status code appropriate to the processing as well as a Bundle containing a list of the SubscriptionTopic resources.

#### 3.114.6.1 Trigger Events

The Resource Notification Broker completed the processing of the request message.

#### 3.114.6.2 Message Semantics

Based on the query results, the Resource Notification Broker will either return an error or success. Guidance on handling Access Denied related to the use of 200, 403, and 404 can be found in ITI TF-2x: [Appendix Z.7](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume2/ch-Z.html#z.7-guidance-on-access-denied-results). When the Resource Notification Broker needs to report an error, it shall use HTTP error response codes and should include a FHIR OperationOutcome with more details on the failure. See FHIR https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/http.html and https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/operationoutcome.html.

If the Resource SubscriptionTopic Search message is processed successfully, the HTTP status code shall be 200. The Resource SubscriptionTopic Search Response message shall be a Bundle Resource containing the SubscriptionTopic Resources. If the Resource Notification Broker is sending warnings, the Bundle Resource shall also contain an OperationOutcome Resource that contains those warnings.

The response shall adhere to the FHIR Bundle constraints specified in ITI TF-2x: [Appendix Z.7](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume2/ch-Z.html#z.1-resource-bundles)

#### 3.114.6.3 Expected Actions

The Resource Notification Subscriber shall process the results according to application-defined rules and be aware of the SubscriptionTopic supported by the Resource Notification Broker.

### CapabilityStatement Resource

The Server implementing this transaction shall provide a CapabilityStatement Resource as described in ITI TF-2x: Appendix Z.3 indicating the transaction has been implemented. 
* Requirements CapabilityStatement for [Client](CapabilityStatement-IHE.ToDo.client.html)
* Requirements CapabilityStatement for [Server](CapabilityStatement-IHE.ToDo.server.html)

### Security Considerations

See [DSUBm Security Considerations](volume-1.html#security-considerations). 

#### Security Audit Considerations

The Resource Notification Subscriber, when grouped with [ATNA](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-9.html) Secure Node or Secure Application Actor, shall be able to record fundamental AuditEvents for [query](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/BALP/1.1.2/StructureDefinition-IHE.BasicAudit.Query.html), using the [BALP](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/BALP/index.html) [basic profile for REST events](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/BALP/content.html#3573-restful-activities).
