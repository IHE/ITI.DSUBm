#### 3.110.5 Create Subscription Request Message
This message uses the HTTP POST method on the target Resource Notification Broker endpoint to submit the subscription resource.

##### 3.110.5.1 Trigger Events

This method is invoked when the Resource Notification Subscriber needs to submit a new subscription resource to the Resource Notification Broker. The Resource Notification Subscriber has already discovered the SubscriptionToipic resource supported by the Resource Notification Broker. (Note that the SubscriptionToipic discovery may be done with the Resource Subscription Search [[ITI-118]](ITI-118.html) (see 1:54.2.2 SubscriptionTopic Search) or by sharing these resources with different methodologies among the community.)

##### 3.110.5.2 Message Semantics

The Resource Notification Subscriber shall initiate an HTTP request according to requirements defined in the HL7® FHIR® standard for “create” interaction [(https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/http.html#create)](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/http.html#create). The message uses an HTTP POST method to submit a Subscription FHIR Resource.

The Subscription resource shall be compliant with [Subscription](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/subscription.html) and shall support the [Profile: R4/B Topic-Based Subscription](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-subscription-backport-ig/StructureDefinition-backport-subscription.html#root). In this resource profile, the Subscription resource must comply with one of the SubscriptionTopic resources implemented by the Resource Notification Broker. The Subscription.criteria element shall include the fullUrl that represents the SubscriptionTopic that the Subscription resource is related to. The Subscription.criteria element shall support the [FilterBy Criteria extension](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-subscription-backport-ig/StructureDefinition-backport-filter-criteria.html#root). This extension shall be used to narrow the subscription triggering events defined in the related SubscriptionTopic resource.  

For document subscription, different types of subscription resources may be submitted to the Resource Notification Broker.

The DSUBm profile specifies the following types of subscriptions:

1. Patient Dependent Document Subscription resource:
    - shall contain in the subscription.criteria element the reference to an existing SubscriptionTopic  resource with SubscriptionTopic.resourceTrigger.resource = DocumentReference;  
    - in the criteria element shall be included a patient identifier (DocumentReference.subject);
    - in the criteria element may be included any additional element of the DocumentReference in order to narrow the subscription topic defined int the subscriptionTopic resource. 
    - the status element shall be requested;
    - the channel.type element must be rest-hook.
    
2. Patient Independent Subscription resource:
    a. Patient Independent Folder Subscription resource:
        - shall contain in the subscription.criteria element the reference to an existing SubscriptionTopic  resource with SubscriptionTopic.resourceTrigger.resource = Folder;  
        - in the criteria element shall not be included a patient identifier (Folder.subject);
        - in the criteria element may be included any additional elements in order to narrow the subscription topic defined int the subscriptionTopic resource. 
        - the status element shall be requested;
        - the channel.type element must be rest-hook.

    b. Patient Independent Document resource:
        - shall contain in the subscription.criteria element the reference to an existing SubscriptionTopic  resource with SubscriptionTopic.resourceTrigger.resource = DocumentReference;  
        - in the criteria element shall not be included a patient identifier (DocumentReference.subject);
        - in the criteria element may be included any additional elements in order to narrow the subscription topic defined int the subscriptionTopic resource. 
        - the status element shall be requested;
        - the channel.type element must be rest-hook.

3. Folder Subscription:
    - shall contain in the subscription.criteria element the reference to an existing SubscriptionTopic  resource with SubscriptionTopic.resourceTrigger.resource = Folder;  
    - a Folder identifier shall be contained in the criteria element;
    - in the criteria element shall be included a patient identifier (Folder.subject);
    - the status element shall be requested;
    - the channel.type element must be rest-hook. 

4. SubmissionSet Subscription:
    - shall contain in the subscription.criteria element the reference to an existing SubscriptionTopic  resource with SubscriptionTopic.resourceTrigger.resource = SubmissionSet List;
    - in the criteria element shall be included the SubmissionSetList.subject element;
    - in the criteria element may optionally be included: the SubmissionSetList.source element and the extension for the [sourceId](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/StructureDefinition/ihe-sourceId) and the extension for the [intendedRecipient](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/StructureDefinition/ihe-intendedRecipient);
    - the status element shall be requested;
    - the channel.type element must be rest-hook.
    

All the subscription resources should support the following extension

- [filter Criteria](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-subscription-backport-ig/StructureDefinition-backport-filter-criteria.html)
- [channel type]( http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/subscriptions-backport/StructureDefinition/backport-channel-type)
- [payload content](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/subscriptions-backport/StructureDefinition/backport-payload-content)

The Resource Notification Subscriber shall indicate in the Subscription.payload element the level of detail of the future notification that the Resource Notification Broker will send. The payload content extension defines three types of payload: 

- empty = No resource content is transacted in the notification payload.
- id-only = Only the resource id is transacted in the notification payload.
- full-resource = The entire resource is transacted in the notification payload.

The Subscription resource shall have a channel.type = "rest-hook" and the element channel.endpoint must contain the URL to which is intended to receive the notification.

<COMMENT For the profiling of these three types of subscription FHIR resources see [here][(Subscription_mapping.html)]() !!! LINK !!!>

The Resource Notification Subscriber actor shall submit the FHIR Subscription resource in either XML format or JSON format thus the media type of the HTTP body shall be either application/fhir+json or application/fhir+xml respectively.

The Resource Subscription message is sent to the base URL as defined in FHIR. See [http://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/http.html](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/http.html) for the definition of “HTTP” access methods and “base”.

It is possible to use HTTP protocol or HTTPS protocol.


##### 3.110.5.3 Expected Actions

Upon receiving the request message the Resource Notification Broker shall verify the following conditions: 

- the SubscriptionTopic (referred in the Subscription.criteria element received in the subscription resource) is valid (SubscriptionTopic.status="active") and is implemented by the Resource Notification Broker;
- all requested filters are defined in the requested topic and are implemented in the Resource Notification Broker;
- the channel type is known and implemented by the Resource Notification Broker;
- the channel endpoint is valid for the channel provided (e.g., is it a valid URL of the expected type);
- the payload configuration is known and implemented by the server
- the payload configuration is valid for the channel type requested (e.g., complies with the Resource Notification Broker security policy).

Based on the outcome of these conditions, the Resource Notification Broker shall accept/reject the subscription resource received. If all the conditions are true the Resource Notification Broker shall create a subscription resource. 
The Resource Notification Broker actor may support the handshake process to verify that the endpoint included in the subscription resource is reachable. If the Resource Notification Broker actor utilizes the handshake to verify the endpoint included in the subscription resource then the Resource Notification Subscriber shall implement the Subscription Search option. 

#### 3.110.6 Create Subscription Response Message

The Resource Notification Broker sends a Resource Subscription Response message to respond to a Resource Subscription Request message.  

##### 3.110.6.1 Trigger Events

When the Resource Notification Broker has finished creating or rejecting the subscription resource received, the Resource Notification Broker sends this message to the Resource Notification Subscriber acknowledging the result of the creation of the resource. 

##### 3.110.6.2 Message Semantics
When the Resource Notification Broker has processed the request, it shall return an HTTP response with an overall status code.

The Resource Notification Broker returns an HTTP status code appropriate to the processing of the create request.
