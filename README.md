Summmary list of major considerations during the previous meets:
- the scope intends to consider subscription for documents, not other sharing resources (e.g. file)
- take consideration on DUSB and its supplement but, at the beginning, not consider the "pull" method describes in the suppl.
- according with the cross-profile consideration in DSUB, mantain the same logic for DSUBm and not consider the grouping as option but explain the most desiderable grouping in the cross-profile paragraph
